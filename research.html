His style of leadership and his traits of being strong, organized, and focused on efficiency. Shows us how small towns such as Stockdale are run currently. For example, local leaders and mayors making decisions to keep their communities running and even just generally functioning.
Napoleon's reforms, like the Napoleonic code, influenced places like Louisiana (and later Texas) and nearby regions. His Louisiana purchase in 1803 expanded U.S territory west and furthermore, made way for American settlers that soon shaped Texas's culture.
Napoleon's leadership showed that small Texan towns can benefit from the influence of healthy traits such as: unity, efficiency, strength, and independence. His ideas connect to the strong sense of free will and freedom that is valued in Texas today.
Napoleon inspired people to be loyal to their nation and created more of a prideful and powerful presence. Similar to Texas, we are very loyal to our state and unity built through our education and laws. Texan communities can use these to solely strengthen community ties and bonds.
Napoleon's focus on written laws and being fair influenced our justice system and showed communities the effect of organization and equality. Studying the Napoleonic era and reminding small towns of their right to conduct strong leadership, keep clear laws, and be prideful of their state and country.</p></div><footer>© 2025 | Lu</footer></body></html>
